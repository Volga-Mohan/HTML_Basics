        In a world of anthropomorphic mammals, rabbit Judy Hopps from rural Bunnyburrow fulfills her childhood dream of becoming a police officer in urban Zootopia. <br>Despite being the academy valedictorian, Judy is delegated to parking duty by Chief Bogo, who doubts her potential because she is a <strong>rabbit</strong>: Chief Bogo believes that smaller mammals are incapable of becoming effective officers. On her first day on the job, she is hustled by a con artist fox duo, Nick Wilde and Finnick. Judy abandons parking duty to arrest Duke Weaselton, a weasel who stole a bag of crocus bulbs known as Midnicampum holicithias. Bogo reprimands her, but an otter, Mrs. Otterton, enters Bogo's office pleading for someone to find her husband Emmitt, one of fourteen animals who have been reported missing. When Judy volunteers and the city's assistant mayor, <i>Dawn Bellwether</i>, praises the assignment, Bogo has no choice but to give Judy the case, stipulating she has forty-eight hours to find Otterton and that she must resign if she fails.
